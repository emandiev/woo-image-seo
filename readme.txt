== Description ==

## Woo Image SEO: The Ultimate Image SEO Plugin for WooCommerce

Boost your SEO with automatic alt and title attributes for your product images!

Woo Image SEO is a simple but powerful SEO plugin that dynamically generates image attributes read by Google, Bing, and other search engines. Enjoy instant results by activating the plugin - no configuration required.

Woo Image SEO helps with accessibility and SEO by automatically adding alt and title attributes to your product images just before they are displayed on your website. This is a great way to improve your website's SEO and make your products more accessible to visually impaired users.

### Better alt tags for your website's images

Alt tags are essential for SEO. They help search engines understand what an image is about. By using the product's name as the alt tag, you can improve your website's SEO and make your products more accessible to visually impaired users. For example, if you have a product called "Amazing Shirt", the product's images will get alt="Amazing Shirt" and title="Amazing Shirt".

You can also enable/disable the generation of each attribute and choose whether to allow for user-specified attributes by going to WooCommerce -> Woo Image SEO. Attributes can include 3 of the following in any order: [product name], [product category], [product tag], [custom text], [site name], [site description], [site domain], and [current date].

### Instant results

Woo Image SEO hooks into a common WordPress function that is called when an image is displayed on your website. This means that the alt and title attributes are generated just before the image is displayed. You don't need to do anything else - just activate the plugin and enjoy the results.

Your actual files or database won't be modified. Once you disable the plugin, the automatically generated attributes will be gone.
